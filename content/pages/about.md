## **Welcome!**

This blog is dedicated to talking about sh*t we couldn't figure out right away. Figured we'd give back to Google and pave the way for others. 

## **Who Are We?**

Two brothers who work as Site Reliability Engineers.

**Miguel Lopez** is a software engineer, AWS enthusiast, and automation specialist @[Hearsay Systems](https://hearsaysystems.com/). 
He loves helping teams build great software through the power of cloud automation. Catch him @ happy hour, a pool hall, or gaming outside of work.

**Sergio Lopez** is a full stack engineer, SPA specialist and SRE @[Choice Hotels](https://www.choicehotels.com/). He loves to create maintainable SPAs using javascript frameworks like angularJS and reactJS. When he's not geeking out, he loves being an on-field mascot for the @[Arizona Diamondbacks](http://arizona.diamondbacks.mlb.com/ari/fan_forum/legends_sweeps.jsp).

## **What does DevLo mean?**

Any Guesses? It's actually nothing fancy! It's short for **Dev**eloper **Lo**pez.
